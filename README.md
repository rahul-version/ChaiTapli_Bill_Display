# ChaiTapli_Bill_Display
This project simulates a menu system for a chai tapri (roadside tea stall). It allows users to view a menu with item names and prices, select items from the menu, and calculate the total price of their order. The program is simple, user-friendly, and demonstrates Python's basic features like dictionaries, loops, and formatted string handling.
